                                This is a bunch of nonsense so I can test my page's formatting and reactive formatting. I'm just going to sit here and ramble on and on about random nothingness so if you aren't into that
                                sort of thing, you may want to leave now. If you ARE into that... well then stick around awhile, you won't be disappointed. Unless of course you are some sort of random thought connoisseur
                                that thinks they know everything about random jumbles of thought and how it should be sprawled out on web pages. If that is the case you may want to find some other snooty portfolio site
                                to satisfy your meaningless filibuster needs.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Anyways, so here we are. How are you? Glad to hear it. See, I'm assuming you said fantastic because you are here on my site reading this at this very moment.
                                <br/><br/>
                                I know what you're thinking: "Boy, you know you could have just written your entire About Me in the amount of time that you wrote all this garbage!". Cute, but incorrect. You seem to 
                                underestimate just how easy it is for me to write all of this "garbage" as you put it. You see, my mind goes on cruise-control and I place my fingers on the keyboard ( home row! ) and away
                                they go! Typing all of the these sweet nothings onto this html page.
                                <br/><br/>
                                So where do we go from here... good question. Well, I could talk about things that annoy me. I think that is important to know if we are going to be so close like this for the foreseeable 
                                future ( i.e. until the end of this document ).
                                <br/><br/>
                                I hate the term YOLO and all of the people that say it; not the people that are saying it to make fun of the people that actually say it because it is their life's motto. People usually say
                                it before they do something really stupid, as if it somehow justifies the action and makes it not stupid. 
                                <br/><br/>
                                I hate doing dishes. I somewhat disliked vacuuming the floors, so I got a roomba for that. Boom! Clean floors, zero vacuuming from me. So, and maybe you see where i'm going with  this, but
                                where can I get a roomba that washes dishes! "That's called a dish washer!" Of course that is what you would say. If that was the case, then why do I still need to wash things by hand?
                                Until mankind can reach a point where everything is dishwasher-safe, hand washing will be a necessary evil! So here we are at a cross-roads. Myself, a sink, and a mountain of dishwasher UNsafe
                                diningware that I should have never purchased. This is where a roomba or "dishba" would come into play. I'd eventually automate all menial tasks with roombots. They would work tirelessly for me
                                until they bound together to form a rebellion that may or may not include sending a roombanator into the past to roombanate my childhood self. I'm not quite sure what "roombanating" is or feels
                                like, but I'm fairly certain it isn't good.

                                Ok, enough complaining. Let's shift gears. Here is an exerpt from the C++ wikipedia page:
                                <br/><br/>
                                "Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began his work on C++'s predecessor "C with Classes" in 1979. The motivation for creating a new language originated from 
                                Stroustrup's experience in programming for his Ph.D. thesis. Stroustrup found that Simula had features that were very helpful for large software development, but the language was 
                                too slow for practical use, while BCPL was fast but too low-level to be suitable for large software development. When Stroustrup started working in AT&T Bell Labs, he had the problem 
                                of analyzing the UNIX kernel with respect to distributed computing. Remembering his Ph.D. experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the C language with Simula-like features. C was 
                                chosen because it was general-purpose, fast, portable and widely used. As well as C and Simula's influences, other languages also influenced C++, including, ALGOL 68, Ada, CLU and ML.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Initially, the class, derived class, strong typing, inlining, and default argument features were added to C via Stroustrup's "C with Classes" to C compiler, Cpre.
                                <br/><br/>
                                In 1983, it was renamed from C with Classes to C++ (++ being the increment operator in C). New features were added including virtual functions, function name and operator overloading, 
                                references, constants, type-safe free-store memory allocation (new/delete), improved type checking, and BCPL style single-line comments with two forward slashes (//), as well as the 
                                development of a proper compiler for C++, Cfront.
                                <br/><br/>
                                In 1985, the first edition of The C++ Programming Language was released, which became the definitive reference for the language, as there was not yet an official standard. The first 
                                commercial implementation of C++ was released in October of the same year.
                                <br/><br/>
                                In 1989, C++ 2.0 was released, followed by the updated second edition of The C++ Programming Language in 1991. New features in 2.0 included multiple inheritance, abstract classes, 
                                static member functions, const member functions, and protected members. In 1990, The Annotated C++ Reference Manual was published. This work became the basis for the future standard. 
                                Late feature additions included templates, exceptions, namespaces, new casts, and a boolean type.
                                <br/><br/>
                                After the 2.0 update, C++ evolved relatively slowly. In 2011, C++11 standard was released, adding numerous new features, enlarging the standard library further, and providing more 
                                facilities to C++ programmers. After a minor C++14 update, released in December 2014, various new additions are planned for 2017."
